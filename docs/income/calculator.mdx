# q!calc

A massive command that is essentially a CHIMPS Cost Calculator

**usage : `q!calc <math expression>`**
Examples:

```
q!calc r99 - wiz#025 - super#052 (2tc test)
q!calc ninja#502 + ninja#030 * 20 * 0.85  (GMN + single-discounted shinobi army)
q!calc vil#002 + (vill#302 + vill#020)*0.85 + vill!400  (camo-mentoring double discount village setup)
```

normal things like `q!calc 1.2*8.9` works, but here are the special bits:

### `r52`,`R100`

Cumulative cash earned after specified round (6-100)

### `wiz!420`, `super!100`, **`dart` (same as `dart!000`)**, **`wlp` (same as `wiz!050`)**

**INDIVIDUAL COST** of tower!upgradeSet

### `wiz#420`, `super#000`

**TOTAL COST** of tower#upgradeSet

### `adora`, `brick`

Base cost of hero (no leveling cost calculations included)

### Operators

+, -, \*, /, % (remainder)
