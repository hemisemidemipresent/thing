# FAQ

## why isnt this bot in the NK server?

topper was reviewing it but it got stuck and the situation hasnt improved

## How do I disable the bot from certain channels?

There are several ways:

### 1. use discord permissions.

a. remove any other roles other than the default "Cyber Quincy" role

b. Go to the channel settings, and add the Cyber Quincy role or the bot to channels that you want the bot work in

::: warning

giving the bot admin will make this method obsolete

(yes I know its weird advising against giving the bot more permissions)
:::

### 2. use `<nocq>`

if you are unfamiliar with permissions, simply put `<nocq>` in the channel topic, and the bot will not respond to any commands in that channel.
